# Notice
# End Of Original Creator Support And Maintenance: July 23rd 2018 
This hud has been taken over by me since the original creator hasn't updated it since [Line above], expect changes that try to be on the same wip design intended though also have some of my taste embedded in them.

# SolarLightHUD
A clean HUD for TF2.

This is a WIP, so expect to see some remnants of the stock HUD and some unfinished elements.

# What does it look like?

# Known Issues

* Pip-boy Engineer HUD does not work correctly

* MVM Medic charge meter overlapping with the Ãœbercharge meter

* Payload race red cart icon texture missing

* TargetID killstreak icon and ammo icon are misplaced

I will fix these issues whenever I have time.
